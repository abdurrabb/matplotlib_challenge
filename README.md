# Observations and Insights 

### 1. The Pearson correlation coefficient measures how data points move in relationship to one another. For mice treated with Capomuline, the average tumor volume and mouse weight measured a Pearson coefficient of 0.84 (see Fig. 5). The average all drugs was 0.66 (see Fig. 10). It seems, for mice on Capomulin, the larger the mouse, the larger the tumor volume. (see Fig. 6).

### 2. Mice on the Capomulin and Ramicane regimens saw an average decrease in tumor volume over 45 days of treatment (see Fig. 3, Fig. 4a, Fig. 7, Fig. 8).

### 3. Capomulin and Ramicane were tests on 10-20% more mice than average (see Fig. 1). These two drugs also saw significantly higher Pearson coefficients than the other drugs tested (see Additional Data).
